            <h1>Experience</h1> 
        </section>
            <ul><p>I have mainly worked in the service and education industry. 
                My first jobs were at restaurants where I gained skills like costumer service and multitasking, these skills later on helped me 
                navigate more complicated but busy and stressuful work environments.
                I worked as secretary for a construction and cleaning company. I wore multiple hats while working there, I created schedules, 
                contacted vendors, facilitated meetings, translated documents, did some bookkeeping, delivered supplies, co-facilitated our 
                hiring process, created flyers.
                I have also worked as translator and interpreter freelancer.
                I currenlty work at a school where I have perfomed different rolls throught the years, I started as a secretary, 
                teacher assitant and most currenlty as a Technology Director Assistant. One of my favorites 
                parts of my job right now is learning new things everyday. As a Technology Assistant I get to interact with everyone, students,
                teachers, parents, new technology and platfomrs that we acquire. I most recently was assigned our school website that is 
                powered up by website builder but that needs to be constantly maintained.
                Last but not least I am also a visual note taker freelancer, visual arts are one of my passions,they helpe me keep my view 
                of the world in multiple perspectives .</p></ul>

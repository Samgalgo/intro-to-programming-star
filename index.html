                I am the parent of a 5 year old child and a fierce chihuahua. I love dancing, making art, going on hikes and relaxing by the river, 
                I also enjoy reading books and spending time with family and friends. I currently work at a school as an Assitant
                Tecnology Director. I am in charge of helping facilitate access to Technology (devices and educational platforms) to students, 
                teachers and parents. I am passionate about learning new things, self discovery and my community.</p></ul>

        </section>
            <ul class="experience-container"><p>I have mainly worked in the service and education industry. 
                My first jobs were at restaurants where I gained skills like costumer service and multitasking, these skills later on helped me 
                navigate more complicated but busy and stressuful work environments.
                I worked as secretary for a construction and cleaning company. I wore multiple hats while working there, I created schedules, 
                contacted vendors, facilitated meetings, translated documents, did some book keeping, delivered supplies, co-facilitated our 
                hiring process and created flyers.
                I have also worked as translator and interpreter freelancer.
                I currently work at a school where I am the Assitant of the Technology Director. One of my favorites 
                parts of my job is learning new things everyday. As a Technology Assistant I get to interact with everyone, students,
                teachers, parents, new technology and platfomrs. 
                Last but not least, I also do visual note taking for events.</p></ul>
